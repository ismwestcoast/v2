# Pianorama Intermediate Course
This is for Junior Course graduates, to further expand musical and technical skills acquired thus far.  The students learn to become more musically independent and work at a more comprehensive level.  The course covers repertoire, technique development, solfege aural concepts, harmonic extension, theory worksheets and ensemble and individual practical work.

# Pianorama Extension Course

Extension Course is for Primary and Intermediate Course graduates.  All musical styles or repertoire with a technical development programme are covered at this level.  This, together with the acquired musical awareness, enables the teacher to work with the students in composition, improvisation, keyboard harmony and theoretical worksheets.  Students cover the AMEB theory syllabus and have the option to present for the AMEB examinations if appropriate.
