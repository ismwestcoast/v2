# Enrolment Terms and Conditions

1. The invoice for the term will be emailed before lessons commence. Fees are payable within 7 days of the first lesson. Any fees that are not paid by the due date on the invoice will incur a $15.00 late payment administration surcharge.

2. Student books and CDs are an expense additional to the fees and an essential part of the course.

3. Should your child miss a lesson for any reason, no refund of fees will be made. Please contact the office to make arrangements for long term illness.

4. Should you wish to discontinue your childâ€™s music tuition at ISM, a minimum of four (4) weeks notice must be given to the school office. No refund will apply if students do not complete the full term.

5. A parent/guardian is required to participate in the lesson with students up to four (4) years of age. After such time parental attendance, whilst desirable, is optional.

6. Siblings can only attend week-day morning classes. Whilst we allow siblings in the class, we do expect parents to be mindful of others in the class and take the child outside the classroom if unsettled or crying. Siblings are not to wander around the classroom or touch the classroom resources. Please be aware that we cannot include the sibling in the class activities.

7. No student will be allowed to leave the premises without an accompanying parent/guardian. Whilst this may be inconvenient, our duty of care requires this.

8. No food or drink is to be brought onto the premises, with the exception of baby bottles and water bottles.
